this is a fork of Lunatic Python, which can be found on the 'net at http://labix.org/lunatic-python.

Sadly, Lunatic Python is very much outdated and won't work with either a current Python or Lua.

This is an updated version of lunatic-python that works with Python 2.7 and Lua 5.1.
I tried contacting the original author of Lunatic Python, but got no response.
